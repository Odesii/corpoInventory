# Corpo Inventory

*Welcome to Corpo Inventory, where "well-documented" is a myth and "it works on my machine" is the standard protocol. Skip this README at your own peril—it's like ignoring the warning label on a firework. Surprisingly common and mildly entertaining for the bystanders.*

## Overview
What we have here is a supposed "system test" for linking Express to a PostgreSQL database. It's as thrilling as watching paint dry, but someone's got to do it, right?

## Features
- **Connection Test**: Verify if Express can even find the Postgres database. It’s like Marco Polo, but less fun.
- **Data Manipulation**: Watch in awe as CRUD operations take place. CRUD, indeed.
- **Error Handling**: Or as I like to call it, "How many ways can this thing fail?"

### DON'T
Honestly, it's better for both of us if you don't try to contact me. If you're desperate, scream into the void; it's just as effective and significantly less annoying for me.
